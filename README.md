This is a test repository for the Kottans course.

I revised some of the forgotten concepts, such as HTTP methods and status codes. What was new for me is the info about Authentication and Caching.

## Git Collaboration

I liked the course from Google; it was well structured and helped me to revise and learn new git commands.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

These courses were useful in terms of going over some concepts in HTML and CSS once more to memorize and understand them better.
