This is a test repository for the Kottans course.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I revised some of the forgotten concepts, such as HTTP methods and status codes. What was new for me is the info about Authentication and Caching.

## Git Collaboration

I liked the course from Google; it was well structured and helped me to revise and learn new git commands.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

These courses were useful in terms of going over some concepts in HTML and CSS once more to memorize and understand them better.

## Responsive Web Design

The info about Grid was new for me. The given materials helped me deepen my knowledge and Grid use skills, evethough I still have to practice it.

## JS Basics

It was the hardest, yet the most useful section so far. Even though I already knew some JS Basics, I discovered many new methods and tools. The tasks on algorithms were the most challenging but the most fun too.

## DOM

Still, the algorithms was the most challenging part.

## Object Oriented JS

The videos about [classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgCiWIdUZ-s&list=PLM7wFzahDYnEltE-aVGhRHYPwIJn0Xquu&index=40&ab_channel=WebDev%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F.%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%9B%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE) and [proptotypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-3GS5-rak8&list=PLM7wFzahDYnEltE-aVGhRHYPwIJn0Xquu&index=46&ab_channel=WebDev%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F.%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%9B%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE) were quite informative. They really helped to get the basics of Object Oriented JS.

The Forgger Game was my favorite part. The amount of information and code to read seemed enourmous at first but as soon as I got the ball rolling it didn't seem as frightening anymore. I completed only the basic requirements for now but I think I am going to get back to this game and add some extra functionality in the future.
