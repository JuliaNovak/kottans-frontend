I revised some of the forgotten concepts, such as HTTP methods and status codes. What was new for me is the info about Authentication and Caching.

## Git Collaboration

I liked the course from Google; it was well structured and helped me to revise and learn new git commands.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

These courses were useful in terms of going over some concepts in HTML and CSS once more to memorize and understand them better.

## Responsive Web Design

The info about Grid was new for me. The given materials helped me deepen my knowledge and Grid use skills, evethough I still have to practice it.  

## JS Basics

It was the hardest, yet the most useful section so far. Even though I already knew some JS Basics, I discovered many new methods and tools. The tasks on algorithms were the most challenging but the most fun too.
